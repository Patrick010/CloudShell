# Kickstarter Pitch: CloudShell for ownCloud

## The Problem
ownCloud is great for syncing files, but power users still need to SSH into servers while working. Right now, that means juggling multiple tools.

## The Solution
CloudShell embeds a secure, browser-based SSH terminal directly into ownCloud. Seamless, native, and controlled.

## Roadmap
- MVP: iframe-based SSH terminal
- Authentication & permissions
- Admin controls
- Extensions (multi-server, session recording)

## Why Back This
- Adds a missing feature to ownCloud
- Open-source, community-driven
- Developed collaboratively with Jules (GPT-5)
